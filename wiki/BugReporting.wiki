#summary Details about reporting bugs for GNUdental(tm)

= Introduction =

There are two projects working on the same general code base.  One is Open Dental (OD).  The other is GNUdental(tm) (GD) which is a *FORK* of OD.  *Currently, only those developers with commit privileges to the OD SVN repo are permitted to report bugs to OD*.  Therefore, we invite any testers to report bugs relating to both GD *and* OD here in this project's issue tracker, but please make sure that you mark the issues you report as affecting either GD or OD or both if you know that both are affected (in which case, please provide details on how the bug manifests itself in both OD and GD).

= Bug Reporting =

The code contained in this Google Code project is GNUdental(tm).  The Open Dental code base exists here: https://70.90.133.65:23793/svn/opendental/

Please feel free to report all bugs in the *Open Dental* code base or the GNUdental(tm) code base using *this issue tracker*.  Although Dr. Sparks recently set up a Bugzilla issue tracker for himself (https://70.90.133.65:23793/bugzilla/index.cgi) he currently does not allow anyone to report bugs there except for those developers who he has authorized to commit changes to his SVN repository.  See http://www.open-dent.com/manual/developers.html under the section entitled "Bugzilla" for more detail.

Thanks.
