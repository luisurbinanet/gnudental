#summary Getting started with GNUdental

= Introduction =

This page will help you get started with GNUdental on your Linux computer.

= Getting Mono =

== Bootstrapping ==
You currently need to have the latest version of Mono installed on your computer. To build Mono from SVN, you first need to have the Mono runtime and C# compiler installed on your computer. 

If you are running ubuntu, you would typically do
{{{
sudo apt-get install mono mono-gmcs mono-gac mono-utils
}}}

*Note:*
 Mono is currently in the universe repository. Make sure you enable this repository.

== Get the latest version from SVN ==
Then, check out Mono from SVN. First you'll need to install [http://subversion.tigris.org Subversion].
If you are running ubuntu, you would typically do
{{{
sudo apt-get install subversion
}}}

You'll need the libgdiplus, mono and mcs modules. See [http://www.mono-project.com/SVN] for more information.

If you are running ubuntu, you would typically do
{{{
svn co svn://svn.myrealbox.com/source/trunk/libgdiplus
svn co svn://svn.myrealbox.com/source/trunk/mono
svn co svn://svn.myrealbox.com/source/trunk/mcs
}}}

There is more! To build mono, you need to have quite some packages installed. Here's a partial list of Ubuntu packages.

== List of required packages ==
*Build tools:*
 * `automake1.9`
 * `autoconf`

*For libgdiplus:*
 * `libexif-dev`
 * `libexpat1-dev`
 * `libfontconfig1-dev`
 * `libfreetype6-dev`
 * `libjpeg62-dev`
 * `libpng12-dev`
 * `libtiff4-dev`
 * `libtiffxx0c2`
 * `libungif4-dev`
 * `libxft-dev`
 * `libxrender-dev`
 * `x11proto-render-dev`

*For mono:*
 * `autotools-dev`
 * `bison`
 * `dpatch`
 * `libtool`
 * `libxml2-dev`
 * `libxslt1-dev`
 * `m4`

== Building Mono ==
To build mono, you would do this:
{{{
cd libgdiplus
./autogen.sh
make
cd ../mono
./autogen.sh
make
}}}

If you encounter any problem, that's most likely because of a missing dependency. Don't proceed as long as you can't build Mono from source!

== Removing the pre-build version of Mono ==
You can now remove the pre-build version of Mono. On Ubuntu:
{{{
sudo apt-get remove subversion
}}}

== Installing Mono ==
{{{
cd ../libgdiplus
sudo make install
cd ../mono
sudo make install
}}}

You are now ready to go!

= Getting NAnt =

NAnt is used to build GNUdental. NAnt probably already ships with your distribtuion. If not, visit [http://nant.sourceforge.net] to download NAnt.

= Building =

Just run `make`. It'll start the build and invoke NAnt.

= Creating the gnudental directories =

It is recommended you create a directory structure like this:
  * /home/user/gnudental/data
  * /home/user/gnudental/data/A
  * /home/user/gnudental/data/...
  * /home/user/gnudental/data/Z
  * /home/user/gnudental/export
  * /home/user/gnudental/letter

= Installing the mySQL database =

Get mySQL from your distribution. GNUdental uses the same database structure as Open Dental. You can get the database creation script from [http://www.open-dent.com/opendental.sql].

You'll need to modify the script a little. Remove this:
{{{
/*
MySQL Backup
Source Host:           localhost
Source Server Version: 4.1.10-nt
Source Database:       opendental
Date:                  2005/03/29 07:56:53
*/
}}}
and replace it with
{{{
create database opendental
}}}

Then, run
{{{
mysql -h localhost -u root < opendental.sql
}}}

= Running GNUdental for the first time =
The first time you run GNUdental, you'll be asked to upgrade your database. Accept to do so. For the data directories, enter the directories you created above. Remember to include a trailing "/" after the directory name. If not, GNUdental will complain.
