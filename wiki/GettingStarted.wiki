#summary Getting started with GNUdental

= Introduction =

This page will help you get started with GNUdental on your Linux computer.

= Getting Mono =

You currently need to have the latest version of Mono installed on your computer. To build Mono from SVN, you first need to have the Mono runtime and C# compiler installed on your computer. 

Then, check out Mono from SVN. You'll need the libgdiplus, mono and mcs modules. See [http://www.mono-project.com/SVN] for more information.

Once you ran `make` in the mono subdirectory, you can remove the mono installation that you got from your distribution. Run `make install` to install the SVN version of Mono.

You are now ready to go!

= Getting NAnt =

NAnt is used to build GNUdental. NAnt probably already ships with your distribtuion. If not, visit [http://nant.sourceforge.net] to download NAnt.

= Building =

Just run `make`. It'll start the build.

= Creating the gnudental directories =

It is recommended you create a directory structure like this:
  * /home/user/gnudental/data
  * /home/user/gnudental/data/A
  * /home/user/gnudental/data/...
  * /home/user/gnudental/data/Z
  * /home/user/gnudental/export
  * /home/user/gnudental/letter

= Installing the mySQL database =

Get mySQL from your distribution. GNUdental uses the same database structure as Open Dental. You can get the database creation script from [http://www.open-dent.com/opendental.sql].

You'll need to modify the script a little. Remove this:
{{{
/*
MySQL Backup
Source Host:           localhost
Source Server Version: 4.1.10-nt
Source Database:       opendental
Date:                  2005/03/29 07:56:53
*/
}}}
and replace it with
{{{
create database opendental
}}}

Then, run
{{{
mysql -h localhost -u root < opendental.sql
}}}

= Running GNUdental for the first time =
The first time you run GNUdental, you'll be asked to upgrade your database. Accept to do so. For the data directories, enter the directories you created above. Remember to include a trailing "/" after the directory name. If not, GNUdental will complain.
