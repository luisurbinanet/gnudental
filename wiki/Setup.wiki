#summary Here we design how GNUdental setup should look like

= Introduction =

GNUdental, obviously, needs a setup package. We'd like our users to be able to easily install GNUdental on their computers.

= Packages =
== Database ==
The GNUdental data generally lives in a mySQL database. We'll provide a package named `gnudental-database` that creates the database.
Ideally, database upgrades also are handled by this package. 

== Server ==
GNUdental comes with a server that uses remoting to talk to the clients and interacts directly with the database. We'll provide a `gnudental-server` package to install the server

== Client ==
The GNUdental client lives in the `gnudental-client` package

== Common ==
Some code is common (OpenDentalBusiness.dll, for example). That should go in `gnudental-common`

= Distribution = 
We, for now, only plan to ship Debian and Ubuntu packages. Once we get that stable, we may look into other distributiosn

= Windows = 
Using WiX to create a native Windows .MSI package may be worth looking into, but is currently not on the radar.
