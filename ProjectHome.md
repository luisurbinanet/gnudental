# First and Foremost #

If you'd like to contribute code to this project, please send email to [info@gnudental.org](mailto:info@gnudental.org) and include the word, 'GNUdental' somewhere in the subject.  Also include your GMail username which is a prerequisite to being a member of this development project while it is hosted by Google (though not a requirement for [joining our community](http://www.gnudental.org/join_form) and contributing in other ways than through writing code).

Also, feel free to join the GNUdental-dev mailing list at http://lists.gnudental.org/mailman/listinfo/gnudental-dev

Feel free to ignore the big **fork** language below.  It's here strictly to annoy the man who had the audacity to '...insist that we should not be talking about 'GNUDental' as a separate project.   We should be talking about OpenDental (sic) and in addition to that
an effort to package it for Linux.'

**NOT !!**

I'll say nothing more about him publicly, but I consider this man to be (currently) ethically bankrupt (if technically perhaps a genius).

### FORK ###

GNUdental<sup>TM</sup> is a **FORK** of Jordan Sparks' Windows®-only Open Dental application.  The primary goal of GNUdental<sup>TM</sup> is to support other operating systems aside from the Microsoft® Windows® family of commercial operating systems that Open Dental has run on exclusively for several years.

### FORK ###

Cross-platform support in Open Dental has long (3+ years) been promised by the author of that application, but those promises were shown to be empty until the announcement of GNUdental<sup>TM</sup>.

### FORK ###

The GNUdental<sup>TM</sup> project members have wearied of waiting any longer.

### FORK ###

Long live free software that is **truly** free!
